# chessUpperBound

## upperBound.py
is an expression that computes a strict upper bound of chess positions.

This is a slightly optimized version of second expression from my paper "Of Games Greater than Ours:..." seen here:

## GeneralTotalPieceCombinations.py
is an expression that counts all of the various unique piece combinations if chess had an arbitrary number of piece types and each piece type had an arbitrary number of duplications.

This algorithm has other applications, but the chess applications was its original inspiration.

The expression in question can also be found in the paper in the link above.
